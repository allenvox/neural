# Neural Networks and PyTorch Projects

![Github last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/allenvox/neural)<br>

This repository contains various assignments and projects related to neural networks, machine learning, and data processing using **PyTorch**. The primary focus is on exploring and implementing foundational concepts such as neural networks, activation functions, and data manipulation techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for all implementations.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework used for building, training, and evaluating neural networks.
- **Torchvision**: A library that provides easy access to popular datasets like MNIST and utilities for working with image data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and detailed explanations of the tasks.

## Setup

To run the code and work with the notebooks, you'll need to install Python and the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/allenvox/neural
    cd neural
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install torch torchvision numpy jupyterlab matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

- The repository contains code files and Jupyter notebooks for various assignments.
- Each notebook or `.py` file is self-contained and focuses on specific concepts related to neural networks or tensor manipulation.
- You can run the notebooks or scripts locally to explore the implementations.
